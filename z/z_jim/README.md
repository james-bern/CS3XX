## more details
<details>
  <summary>🐛 debugging</summary>

#### basic usage
- click to the left of a line number (red circle should appear) to toggle a breakpoint
#### troubleshooting
- **known issue -- pause button doesn't work at first in VS Code**
  - workaround: hit a manual breakpoint and resume, then pause should work

 <summary>ℹ️ about the codebase</summary>
  
#### design philosophy
the CSCI-371 codebase was designed to
- compile very fast
- run fast enough
- be simple
- be small
- not require an IDE
 
#### fun facts
- the codebase is using a [unity build](https://hero.handmade.network/forums/code-discussion/t/2651-unity_builds_in_practice) (smoosh everything into one file and compile it; no incremental building; no relation to the game engine)

 <summary>🎉 C/C++ fun facts</summary>

```c
// // stack-allocated fixed-size arrays

// stack-allocated fixed-size array of 16 doubles filled with garbage
double a[16];

// same thing but filled with zeroes
double a[16] = {}; 

// these three lines are equivalent
double a[3] = { 0, 0, 0 };
double a[3] = {};
double a[] = { 0, 0, 0 };

// consider a function foo that takes a pointer to a double
void foo(double *bar);
// if we call foo on a fixed size array bar, then inside the body of foo
// the argument bar will no longer be a fixed size array
// it will have "decayed into a pointer"
```

```c
// // heap-allocated arrays

// b is a pointer to heap-allocated array of 1000 doubles filled with garbage
double *b = (double *) malloc(1000 * sizeof(double));

// same thing but filled with zeroes
double *b = (double *) calloc(1000, sizeof(double));
// ^ equivalent to calling malloc as above and then calling
// memset(b, 0, 1000 * sizeof(double));       
```

```c
// // structs

// this is a struct containing two doubles followed by two ints followed by a pointer to a Poe    
struct Poe {                                                                               
    double x, y;                                                                             
    int i, j;                                                                              
    Poe *twin;                                                                             
};                                                                                         

// stack-allocated struct of type Poe filled with garbage
Poe poe;

// same thing but filled with zeroes
Poe poe = {};
// for the example struct, this is equivalent to Poe poe = { 0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, NULL };          
// which we can also write as Poe poe = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 } without the compiler complaining    

// stack-allocated fixed-size array of 5 Poe's filled with zeroes
Poe poes[5] = {};

// pointer to a heap-allocated array of 9999 Poe's filled with garbage
Poe *poes = malloc(9999 * sizeof(Poe));

// you can partially intialize an array or struct (unspecified arguments filled with zeros)  
// e.g. Poe poe = { 3.14, -4.2, 1 }; is the same as Poe poe = { 3.14, -4.2, 1, 0, NULL };    

// the journey continues...                                     
Poe poe_array[4] = { { 1.3, 0, 5 }, {}, { .2, .4, 1, 3 } };
```

```c
// // white space

void purple (int *cow) {               
     *cow += 5;                        
}                                      
                                       
// is the same as                         
                                       
void purple(int*cow){*cow+=5;}         
                                       
// is the same as                         
                                       
void                                   
   purple      (int                    
* cow) {                               
  *                                    
cow += 5     ;              }          
```

```c
// // struct / class basics

// both the . and the -> let me access the fields of a struct/class
// .  is when we have the thing                                    
// -> is when we have a pointer to the thing                       
// rule of thumb: pass by pointer when we need to modify the thing 
// (e.g. sbuff_push_back)
