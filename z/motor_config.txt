======

assumptions
------
- all spool radii are 0.02 m (i.e., spool diameter = 4 cm)
- all motors have baudRate = 1Mbps
- all motors are in Extended Position Mode
- all motors have been zeroed using homing offset so 0 is robot's rest position (cables just barely tense)

safety
------
- double clicking the executable will automatically power on the motors and send them 0
  - it is VERY important that the assumptions above are followed!!
    - otherwise the robot may be destroyed
- if assumptions valid, API (hopefully) never sends targets outside [ -50mm,  50mm] to top 3 motors
- if assumptions valid, API (hopefully) never sends targets outside [-100mm, 100mm] to other motors

notes (epfl)
------------

COM port can be found by searching "device manager" in windows

unless something very strange happens
- LED's ON = Torque ON;
- LED's OFF = Torque OFF

* using a dummy com port (e.g., COMX) will make the code run without trying to send commands to the motors

** you can use -1 as a "dummy id" (is ignored)

*** motor sign is +1 if increasing the angle (turning counter-clockwise) tightens the tendon


notes (williams)
----------------
API has two functions
- void kaa_dxl_init_FORNOW_ASSUMES_9_MOTORS(char *filename); which takes a config file as described above
- void kaa_dxl_write(real *u); which takes cable contractions in meters (exactly the same format as the sim is already in)

FORNOW serial port is write-only (we don't read motor positions back, we just "spray and pray")
