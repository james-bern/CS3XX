!!! important
------------
script currently has NO SAFETY FEATURES (will tear robot apart)
- i recommend first testing pipeline on a single motor that is not connected to anything
- then nine motors that aren't connected to anything


assumptions
------
- motors...
-- have baud rate 57600
-- are in extended position mode
-- have been zeroed (this can be done using Homing Offset in the Dynamixel Wizard)
--- (motors current position of zero should correspond to the robot's rest position (cables just barely tense)


notes (epfl)
------------

COM port can be found by searching "device manager" in windows**
** using a dummy com port (e.g., COMX) will make the code run without trying to send commands to the motors

motor sign is +1 if increasing the angle (turning counter-clockwise) tightens the tendon

* you can use -1 as a "dummy id" (is ignored)

FORNOW serial port is write-only (we don't read motor positions back, we just "spray and pray")



notes (williams)
----------------
API has two functions
- void kaa_dxl_init_FORNOW_ASSUMES_9_MOTORS(char *filename); which takes a config file as described above
- void kaa_dxl_write(real *u); which takes cable contractions in meters (exactly the same format as the sim is already in)
