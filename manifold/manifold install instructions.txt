include algorithm in public.h
copy tbb.lib into a duplicate called tbb_debug.lib (wtf)
NOTE: make sure to use Z7 so you don't have to ship the pdb as well

IF you messed up in cmake-gui and are building a dll instead of libs (and don't want to start all the way over):
- Go to Project->Properties. Under "General" set "Configuration Type" to "Static Library (.lib)". Then under "Linker" change the extension of the Output File to .lib . Then you're good to go. Remember to do these for all your configurations (Debug, Release etc.)
(then right click all, including Clipper2 which is hidden inside Libraries folder) and hit Rebuild
search for *.lib with windows search and all 6 will show up
- set output extension of manifoldc to .lib (you will need to type .lib into the field by hand)

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/elalish/manifold.git
cd manifold
mkdir build
cd build
cmake "-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release "-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=x86_64;arm64" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DMANIFOLD_JSBIND=OFF -DMANIFOLD_PYBIND=OFF -DMANIFOLD_CBIND=ON -DMANIFOLD_PAR=OFF -DMANIFOLD_TEST=OFF .. && make

NOTE: FORNOW: TBB is off (i think this will probably make things a lot slower on mac :()
