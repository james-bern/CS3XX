Objects
-------
i have only two kinds of objects

- objects that behave like primitives (in my head, i imagine they *are* primitives)
  vec3 a = { 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f };
  vec3 b = a; // works just like a was a float; no aliasing! i shouldn't have to think!
  a += b; 

- objects that literally are plain old data structs
  (no constructors, no destructors, no operator overloading, no blah blah blah)
  Mesh mesh = {}; // clears struct to zero
  Camera camera_2D = make_Camera2D(...); // fills struct with something nice


asserts, etc.
-------------
- i love ASSERT(...);
  ASSERT(2 + 2 == 5); // crash! tell me where! break if i'm in a debugger!

- i like (automatic) bounds checks
  vec3 v;
  v[3] = 5; // crash!

strings
-------
- prefer String
- "CString" (null-terminated char *) is ooookay
